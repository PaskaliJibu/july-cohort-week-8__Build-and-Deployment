      <h2>Why Nutrition Matters for Children</h2>
      <p>Proper nutrition is essential for the growth and development of children. It boosts immunity, supports brain development, and ensures strong physical growth.</p>
      
      <h3>Key Elements of Child Nutrition:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>✔ Proteins – build and repair body tissues</li>
        <li>✔ Vitamins & Minerals – boost immunity and brain function</li>
        <li>✔ Carbohydrates – provide energy for growth and play</li>
        <li>✔ Water – essential for hydration and body functions</li>
        <li>In addition to grains and tubers, feed your baby a variety of foods – especially animal foods (dairy, eggs, meat, fish and poultry), fruits and vegetables – every day.</li>

        <li>Breastfeeding is the best way to provide young infants with the nutrients they need for healthy growth and development. It is recommended to exclusively breastfeed for the first six months of life, and then continue breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond.</li>
        <li>Ensure that children have access to a variety of foods from all food groups to meet their nutritional needs.</li>
        <li>Limit sugary snacks and beverages to prevent obesity and dental issues.</li>
        <li>Encourage regular physical activity to promote overall health and well-being.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A balanced diet ensures that children can thrive academically, socially, and physically.</p>
